		<p>There's much written on www about the history of the internet. For example, about the first graphical Internet browser on the web. </p>
		
		
		<blockquote>NCSA Mosaic 1.0Mosaic is the first widely used graphical 
		World Wide Web browser developed and first released on 
		April 22, 1993 by the NCSA with the help of Marc Andreessen 
		and Eric Bina. A big competitor to Mosaic was Netscape, which 
		was released a year later. </blockquote>

		<p><q>
		Today's Internet browsers we use 
		today, e.g. Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, etc., got 
		their inspiration from the Mosaic browser.
