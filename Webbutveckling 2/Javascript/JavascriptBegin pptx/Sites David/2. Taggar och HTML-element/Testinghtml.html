The default language for writing HTML is english. 
HTML is used to select parts of a text.
Using these selections, the text can be formatted in different ways, much like a
word processor.	<br><br><!-- linebreaks -->

<p> <!-- paragraph -->
	Create a paragraph with the &lt;p&gt;-tag.
	A paragraph automatically adds an empty line before and after the text
	that is written inside the &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;-element.
</p>
This text is written after the &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;-element.

<p> <!-- paragraph -->
	A special thing with text on web pages is automatic linebreaks and new
	lines if the text does not fit the window.
	Try this by changing the width of the browser window from wide to narrow.
</p>

<h1>Finally we look at some heading, first the largest one.. </h1>
<h3>..then and a medium sized heading..</h3>
<h6>..and a really small one.</h6>







<!--Linebreaks or empty lines in your code editors are not carried over to the web
page. There are three sentences, each on a separate line, in your code editor.
On the web page these sentences are shown directly after each other. To get a
linebreak after each sentance on the web page the &lt;br&gt;-tag have to be used.
<br><br>

<!-- Comments in HTML is done like this. Comments are used for explaining
something for other coders. Comments will not show up in your web page-->
